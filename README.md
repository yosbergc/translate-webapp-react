## Overview
This project showcases a sleek and modern design that's fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.

## Features
- **Multi-Language Support**: Effortlessly translate text between English, French, and Spanish.
- **Copy Functionality**: A convenient button allows users to copy translated text directly to their clipboard.
- **Attractive Design**: A modern and appealing interface that engages users.
- **Efficient Translation**: Utilizes the `mymemory.translated.net` API for quick and reliable translations.

## How It Works
The core of this application is built on React's powerful context system, providing a global state that manages:
- Current text and its translations.
- Language selection and switching functionality.
- Loading states for asynchronous operations.

With a simple yet effective layout, users can input text, select their desired translation languages, and receive the translated output in an instant.
